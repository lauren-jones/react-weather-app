## React Weather App

A simple weather application with an integrated 5-day forecast for thousands of cities around the world, built with React, JavaScript and CSS.

## Live preview

A live preview of the weather app is hosted here on netlify: https://voluble-cobbler-ef636c.netlify.app/

## Reflection

This was a side project built during the SheCodes Pro bootcamp. Project goals included implementing React knowledge learned up until this point, and integrating a REST API into the project using Axios.

The API used to retrieve weather data in this project is the OpenWeather API: https://openweathermap.org/api
